# NN-Face-Classification

This project explores the fundamentals of machine learning through the creation of an neural network system from scratch using only Numpy and Pandas. Initially, I had created a folder on my local device that archived all my research and experiments towards the basics of neuron input and outputs, added biases and impact of weights, activation influence of sigmoids and ReLus, and finally the importance of forward and backward propagation.
