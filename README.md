# NN-Face-Classification

This project explores the fundamentals of machine learning through the creation of an neural network system from scratch using only *Numpy* and *Pandas*. 

> Initially, I had created a folder on my local device that archived all my research and experiments towards the basics of neuron input and outputs, added biases and impact of weights, activation influence of sigmoids, and finally the importance of forward and backward propagation. Furthermore, understanding **__all__** the math behind backward propagation with the use of partial derivitives and gradients vectors in minimizing the loss.

Though creating this repository allowed me to then experiment with more complex datasets and different activation and loss functions like ReLus and Binary Cross Entropy which helped my neural network work more efficiently.

The dataset collected was generated from cannguyen275's repository [isFace](https://github.com/cannguyen275/isFace/tree/master)'s dataset and used to be fed into my scratch neural network.
